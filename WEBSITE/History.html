            <h2>The History of the Internet: From ARPANET to the World Wide Web</h2>
            <p>
                The internet, as we know it today, has evolved over decades, transforming how we communicate, share information, and conduct business globally. From its early beginnings as a military project to becoming an integral part of daily life, the internet’s history is a fascinating journey of innovation and collaboration.
            </p>

            <h3>The Early Days: ARPANET and Packet Switching</h3>
            <p>
                The story of the internet begins in the 1960s, during the Cold War. The U.S. Department of Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) funded a project to create a communication system that could survive a nuclear attack. This led to the development of ARPANET, the predecessor of the modern internet, in 1969.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the key figures was <strong><a href="timeline.html">Paul Baran</a></strong>, who developed the idea of a distributed network that didn’t rely on a single control point. This concept of "packet switching" allowed data to be broken into small packets and sent independently across the network, ensuring communication even if parts of the network were damaged.
            </p>

            <h3>The Development of TCP/IP: Standardizing the Internet</h3>
            <p>
                In the 1970s, ARPANET connected universities and research institutions across the U.S., but there was a need for a standardized way to communicate. Enter <strong><a href="timeline.html">Vint Cerf</a></strong> and <strong><a href="timeline.html">Bob Kahn</a></strong>, who in 1974 developed TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol). TCP/IP became the backbone of internet communication, allowing different networks to connect and "talk" to each other, forming the foundation for what would become the global internet.
            </p>

            <h3>The Birth of the World Wide Web</h3>
            <p>
                While the internet was primarily used by academics and the military in the 1980s, everything changed with the invention of the <strong>World Wide Web</strong> (WWW) in 1989 by <strong> <a href="timeline.html">Tim Berners-Lee</a></strong>. Working at CERN, Berners-Lee created a system that allowed documents to be linked together using <em>hypertext</em>. He also developed HTML (HyperText Markup Language), URLs (Uniform Resource Locators), and HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol), which became the building blocks of the web.
            </p>
            <p>
                The World Wide Web made the internet accessible to the general public, allowing users to browse and share information through web browsers. The first web browser, <strong>Mosaic</strong>, developed by <strong>Marc Andreessen</strong> and his team in 1993, made the internet user-friendly, leading to a massive increase in users.
            </p>

            <h3>The Dot-Com Boom: Commercialization of the Internet</h3>
            <p>
                As the web grew in popularity, businesses began to recognize its potential. In the mid-1990s, the <strong>dot-com boom</strong> took off as companies rushed to establish an online presence. E-commerce emerged with platforms like <strong>Amazon</strong> (founded in 1994) and <strong>eBay</strong> (founded in 1995), forever changing the way people shop.
            </p>
            <p>
                Search engines like <strong>Yahoo!</strong> and <strong>Google</strong> (founded in 1998) revolutionized how people find information online, while social media platforms like <strong>Facebook</strong> (2004) and <strong>Twitter</strong> (2006) changed how we communicate and share content.
            </p>

            <h3>The Mobile Revolution and Beyond</h3>
            <p>
                In the 2000s, the internet became more mobile with the rise of smartphones and wireless technology. The introduction of the <strong>iPhone</strong> in 2007 marked a new era of internet use, where users could access the web from virtually anywhere. Today, with advancements in <strong>5G</strong> technology and the rise of the <strong>Internet of Things (IoT)</strong>, the internet is more integrated into our daily lives than ever before.
            </p>
            <p>
                The development of cloud computing, video streaming services like <strong>YouTube</strong>, and platforms like <strong>Netflix</strong> have further transformed how we consume media. Moreover, tools like <strong>Google Drive</strong> and <strong>Dropbox</strong> have made it easier to store and share information globally.
            </p>

            <h3>Conclusion: A Constantly Evolving Network</h3>
            <p>
                The history of the internet is marked by rapid innovation, collaboration, and a drive to connect people and share knowledge. What started as a military communication tool has become the backbone of modern society, driving economies, influencing politics, and shaping cultures. As we look to the future, technologies such as <strong>AI</strong>, <strong>blockchain</strong>, and <strong>Web3</strong> promise to push the internet even further, making it an even more integral part of our lives.
