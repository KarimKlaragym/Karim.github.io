            <h2>Internet Timeline</h2>
            <p>The history of the internet is filled with contributions from various individuals. Here are some of the key figures and their innovations:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>PAUL BARAN (1926–2011)</strong><br>
                Paul created a communication network without a central control point, meaning if one point was destroyed, all others would still function. This concept, called a distributed network, was crucial for military use during wartime.</li>
                
                    <li>
                        <div class="image-content">

                        Paul Baran - Pioneer of Distributed Networks
                    </li>
                   
                
                    
                <li><strong> BOB KAHN (1938–) AND VINT CERF (1943–)</strong><br>
                    American computer scientists who developed TCP/IP, the set of protocols that governs how data moves through a network. This helped the ARPANET evolve into the internet we use today. Vint Cerf is credited with the first written use of the word ‘internet’. 
                    “When asked to explain my role in the creation of the internet, I generally use the example of a city. I helped to build the roads—the infrastructure that gets things from point A to point B” -Vint Cerf, 2007.
                   </li>

                <li><strong>LAWRENCE ROBERTS (1937–2018)</strong><br>
                Lawrence was responsible for developing computer networks and supported Paul Baran's idea. He worked on improving the distributed network, collaborating with others such as Leonard Kleinrock.</li>

                <li><strong>PAUL MOCKAPETRIS (1948–) AND JON POSTEL (1943–1998)</strong><br>
                These two were the creators of the DNS (Domain Name System), often referred to as the "phone book of the internet."</li>

                <li><strong>TIM BERNERS-LEE (1955–)</strong><br>
                Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web (WWW). He also developed several technologies we use today, such as HTML (HyperText Markup Language), HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol), URLs, and web browsers.</li>
