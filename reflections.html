            <h2>Reflections on the Web's Impact</h2>
            <h3>Impact on Individuals</h3>
            <p>
                Since the internet became accessible to homes in the 1990s, it has transformed how people live, work, and communicate. The web has become a crucial part of daily life, allowing instant access to information, entertainment, and social connections. Over time, online services such as banking, shopping, and remote work have grown, giving individuals more convenience but also raising privacy concerns.
            </p>

            <h3>Impact on Businesses and Organizations</h3>
            <p>
                Over the past 30 years, the internet has revolutionized how companies and governments operate. Businesses have embraced online platforms for marketing, e-commerce, and customer engagement, while governments have digitized services to increase accessibility and efficiency. This shift has led to the creation of new industries, jobs, and innovations but also caused disruptions in traditional sectors.
            </p>

            <h3>Impact on Societies Globally</h3>
            <p>
                The web has had different effects on societies depending on factors such as GDP. In developed countries, the internet has led to increased digital literacy, economic growth, and new social dynamics. In contrast, in regions with lower GDPs, limited infrastructure and access to the web have created a digital divide, leaving many communities unable to fully participate in the digital economy. These disparities highlight the need for global initiatives to bridge the gap and ensure that everyone can benefit from web access.
